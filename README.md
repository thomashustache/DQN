# Deep Reinforcement Learning 

A rat runs on an island and tries to eat as much as possible. The island is subdivided into N * N cells, in which there are cheese (+0.5) and poisonous cells (-1). The rat has a visibility of 5 * 5 cells around itself. The rat is given a time T to accumulate as much food as possible. It can perform 4 actions: going up, down, left, right.
The goal is to code an agent to solve this task that will learn by trial and error.
